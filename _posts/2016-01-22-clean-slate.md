Learning how to use Github pages is fun and easy!

I was looking for a free and secure space to setup a site for my CV and write about more random stuff.

I have come across Github pages some time ago but haven't looked into it until now.

All you need is the following:

1. Free Github Account
2. Jekyll Fork
3. Domain Name


As a starting point, going over the [README](https://github.com/techimpossible/techimpossible.github.io/blob/master/README.md) file is adequate.

A more detailed article on the ins and outs of this can be found [here](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/).

## Why?

Well having a Free blog that doesn't use scripts and thus has no vulnerabilities is very exciting in today's world.

Enjoy!
