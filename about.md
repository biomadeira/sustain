## The Author

Ethan Gregory Dodge is a cyber security and privacy professional with an active mind, developing many thoughts and opinions. He can often be found sporting a Denver Broncos 9fifty with his headphones on top, listening to his favorite podcast or book or writing terrible code late into the night. An exmormon, Ethan has been scarred by misinformation and is committed to truth and transparency. In this site are his thoughts, worries, and ideas.

## The Categories 
_The separation of the two blogs is in effort to not annoy the readership of the tech portion with potentially controversial opinions when they just want to read about Ethan's passions and doings within the tech space._

### Tech [<i class="fa fa-rss"></i>](/tech/atom.xml)
Ethan is always working on some sort of project and exploring new technologies. Here you can find articles on topics such as cyber security, privacy online, digital forensics, incident response, open source intelligence, etc.

### Opinion [<i class="fa fa-rss"></i>](/opinion/atom.xml) 
Originally this site was just one blog, Ethan's tech blog, but with recent events Ethan feels an obligation to express his opinions, ideas, and concerns more freely with everyone. This blog exists to help Ethan share these thoughts and to serve as a medium to cultivate his passions for good writing and great journalism.
