*This is the first article of a 5 part series following my experience with and thoughts on [The Privacy Paradox](https://project.wnyc.org/privacy-paradox/), a "5-day plan to take back your digital identity" from the [Note To Self](https://www.wnyc.org/shows/notetoself) podcast. This article largely assumes that you have already listened to today's episode, which you can do [here](https://www.wnyc.org/story/privacy-paradox-day-1-challenge/).*

The first episode of the Privacy Paradox starts out with the always lovely [Bruce Schneier](https://www.schneier.com/). This guy is very smart and his technical opinions are very well respected within the industry. His first quotes sounded like a quote right out of the first chapter of his book [Data and Goliath](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25622873-data-and-goliath) (which I recommend). He starts off by implying that having a smartphone with you constantly is the equivalent of carrying a tracking device, that adding a friend on Facebook is like informing the police that we have met someone new, or that using Gmail is like sending the police a copy of all of our correspondence. Now I'm not usually one that likes to motivate by fear, but his analogies, as disturbing as they are, are completely rational. The truth is that your cellular service provider, Facebook, and Google do have all that sensitive information about you and, with the right warrant, can be obligated to hand it over to law enforcement. So perhaps a more specific analogy would be sending the police all that information but they never look at it unless they need it for an investigation.

I am sure that many just thought to yourselves "What's the likelihood that the police are going to want my information?" That is a great question! The answer depends on several things. Things such as who you associate with, where you go during the day, what your interests are, etc. For example, I am positive I am on an NSA watchlist simply because of my [interest in privacy and privacy tools](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2014/07/03/nsa_xkeyscore_stasi_scandal/). I'm not going to go too much into my opinion on surveillance in this in this article, but if you want to read more about the potential dangers and side effects, [this is a good place to start](https://www.theguardian.com/science/head-quarters/2015/mar/18/the-psychology-of-mass-government-surveillance-how-do-the-public-respond-and-is-it-changing-our-behaviour). And if you want to go even further than that, I recommend picking up [Schneier's book](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25622873-data-and-goliath).

Schneier then explains the difference between data and metadata. The simple definition of metadata is "data about data". In this particular situation, the data would be the actual content of your conversations and correspondence, whereas metadata are things like what phone numbers you called, how long you were on the phone, where you were when you were talking, where you went after you were done talking, etc. Or in the case of the Internet, it would be who you're receiving email from, how often, if you respond, what websites you visit, how long you stay there, etc. This easily allows whoever has this data to paint a picture of what you do everyday, what online services you use, what illnesses you have, if you have depression, etc. This can all get incredibly personal very quickly and the services we use online use it marketing purposes. The advertisements we see online are tailored to us based on all this information.

Not a lot of this is news, we all know Google is an advertising company and they function by providing us free services and presenting us with targeted ads. But what about that flashlight app on your phone? Or Angry Birds? This episode points out that it is rare for people to read through the entire usage policy when signing up for a new service. They're long and confusing, this is intentional. Remember when Pokemon Go came out and the streets were filled with people hunting the little things? When the game was initially released, it asked for [full permissions](https://www.cnet.com/how-to/pokemon-go-google-account-access/) to your Google account: your email, docs, contacts, Google+, everything. Niantic, the creators, later [explained](https://twitter.com/MattStoneABC/status/752675066693976066) that the issue was an accidental oversight. Regardless, the situation paints a perfect picture of how quick we are to ignore potential privacy and security implications. What if it was an app that was tracking your location even when the app wasn't being used, like [Uber](https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/28/uber-background-location-data-collection/).

The challenge given this week was to audit your own phone and take a look at what kind of data your apps are collecting. This is actually something that I do regularly. I like to know what kind of permissions apps ask for and why. One permission that I almost always deny unless absolutely needed is location. It personally makes me really uncomfortable thinking that apps are accessing my location and storing it for future use. The only apps that have access to my location data are Google Maps and Lyft. Calendar, Evernote, and many other apps ask for it, but I deny it to them. In fact, by default I always have location services turned off unless I need it to find my way to a place I have never been to before.

Many times the app only needs access to a an asset on your phone to enable a certain feature. For example, when you first install Twitter or Facebook, you'll typically be asked for access to your contact list. I always deny these requests because I never plan on using my phone contacts to find people I know on social media, so I don't want Twitter to needlessly store who else I know besides those whom I follow.

Keep in mind that these are all very personal decisions. Are you ok with certain apps knowing where you are all the time? Or maybe you don't care if Facebook uses all of your phone contacts to find people you know. Either way, that is totally fine. The important thing is that you are aware of what is happening and are empowered to stop it in the future or to prevent it from happening on other apps perhaps you do not trust.

I am excited to see what the Privacy Paradox brings us tomorrow.
