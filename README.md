Personal blog built with [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/), [SASS](https://sass-lang.com), powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and freely
hosted in [Github pages](https://pages.github.com/).

This version is a fork of [Sustain](https://github.com/jekyller/sustain) but features a number of improvements:
1. Upgrade from Bootstrap 3 to Bootstrap 4
2. Uses SCSS instead of CSS
3. Implements a best practice directory hierarchy and filename convention outlined by [Ben Balter](http://ben.balter.com/jekyll-style-guide/)
